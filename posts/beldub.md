Beldub is a platform about the Belgian dub and sound system culture. The website, [Beldub.be](https://beldub.be), was created to bring all this information together in one place and make it accessible to a wider audience. The website features an events calendar, a directory of sound systems, articles, and videos, and an interactive map showcasing the different sound systems and events happening in the country.

During the development of beldub.be, I followed a design thinking process to ensure that the website would meet the needs of the Belgian dub and soundsystem community. This involved conducting research to understand the needs and pain points of the target audience, defining the problem and goal of the website, ideating and prototyping different concepts and features, and testing them with users to incorporate feedback into the final design.

To build the website, I used various technologies to ensure a fast and user-friendly experience. For the front-end, I chose to use Gatsby.js, a static site generator that allowed for fast loading times and optimized SEO. The back-end was built with Strapi, an open-source CMS that allowed for easy content management and integration with the front-end. I also integrated Cloudinary for fast image delivery, Docker, and Netlify/Git for continuous deployment.

Throughout the development process, I faced several challenges, such as the implementation of a mobile-friendly design and the integration of a search functionality. However, by staying true to the design thinking process and using the appropriate technologies, I was able to overcome these challenges and deliver a final product that met the needs of the target audience.

Overall, the development process for beldub.be was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to showcase my skills in web development and design thinking.
