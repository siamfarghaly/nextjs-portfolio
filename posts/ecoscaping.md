To create the website for the garden architect at [ecoscaping.be](https://www.ecoscaping.be/), I worked closely with the architect to develop a design that showcased their unique style and approach to landscaping. Using WordPress and Elementor, I created a responsive website that featured a portfolio of the architect's work, an overview of their services, and a contact form for potential clients to get in touch. 

The end result was a visually appealing website that effectively promoted the garden architect's business to a wider audience.
