To create the website for the boxing club at [savate-zemst.be](https://savate-zemst.be/), I first worked with the club to define the purpose and audience of the site. The primary goal was to attract new members to the club and keep current members informed about upcoming events and training sessions.

Using WordPress and Elementor, I developed a responsive website that featured information about the club's history, instructors, training programs, and membership options. I also included a calendar of events and a contact form to allow visitors to get in touch with the club. The design was clean and modern, with bold typography and imagery that reflected the energy and intensity of the sport. The end result was a visually appealing and informative website that effectively promoted the boxing club to a wider audience.
